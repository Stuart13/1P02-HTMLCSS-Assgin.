    <p class="textsize"> The reason I decided I wanted a working TARDIS is because it could bring me back to the good old days when I didn't have a care in the world.
      It could also bring me back to times when I was on vacation, just so I could experience them all over again.  </p>

			<p class="textsize"> Personally, I would head back to <strong> Disney World in 2010 </strong>.  </p>
		</div>
		<p class="textsize">	I went with a close friend of mine believe it or not and it was a whole lot of fun.  We went on the
      <em> Tower of Terror </em> (before it was shut down) and other rides such as <em> Space Mountain </em>. I'd probably also use the TARDIS to explore
      space and all that fun stuff but I'm pretty sure my priorities are in check when I say Disney World comes first. </p>

    <h2 class="titlefont">Other Ideas That Didn't Make The List </h2>
    <ul class="textcolor">
      <li class="li2">A puppy </li>
      <li class="li3">Another puppy </li>
      <li class="li4">A cat because a third puppy is a crowd </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="textsize"> The reason behind not placing any pets on my main list is simply because I think I'm aiming <em> too high </em>.  I believe that my parents would
      start off small with maybe a guinea pig or a goldfish just to see whether I am responsible enough to take care of a pet.  Unfortunately, I hate fish
      because they're slimy and I hate guinea pigs because they're not dogs or cats.  These opinions put me in <strong> quite </strong> the unfortunate
      position, so I'll just have to convince my parents sometime before Christmas to let me get <strong> 3 pets all at once </strong>.  I heard somewhere
      that if you get a pet on christmas you'll treat it more like a present than a living being, so I'm thinking maybe I should wait a bit just so I don't
      fall under the same pretenses. </p>
